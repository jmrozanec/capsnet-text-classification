 - dataset-analysis.ipynb: to obtain general information regarding the dataset: most frequent terms, which cannot be represented as embeddings, most frequent words particular to a specific topic, etc.
 - XGBoost.ipynb: classification performed with XGBoost
 - ConvRec.ipynb: ConvRec implementation and dataset classification
 - CapsNet.ipynb: CapsNet implementation and dataset classification
